## SecureBBA for Mobile Banking Security ##

What is SecureBBA? 
SecureBBA is a smart system to keep mobile banking apps safe from hackers, even after a user logs in. Normally, banking apps check your identity only at login (with a password or fingerprint). But what if someone steals your login details or takes over your session? SecureBBA solves this by watching how you use your phone all the time while you’re in the app. It learns your unique habits—like how fast you type, how you swipe, or how you hold your phone—and checks if someone else is pretending to be you. If it notices something unusual, it can lock the app or ask you to prove it’s really you.

The system uses a simple machine learning model to spot strange behavior and acts quickly to protect your money, all while being easy to use and respecting your privacy. It works on your phone itself, so your data doesn’t leave your device.

Features to Build

Here are the main features SecureBBA will include:

Learning User Habits:
* The system will watch and learn how you use the banking app, like:
* How fast you type your PIN or messages.
* How you swipe or tap on the screen (speed, pressure, patterns).
* How you hold your phone (using sensors like the gyroscope).
* The way you move between app screens (e.g., checking balance, then transferring money).
* Spotting Strange Behavior: Using a lightweight machine learning model (called Isolation Forest), SecureBBA will notice if someone else is using your account by comparing their actions to your usual habits.
Smart Actions When Something’s Wrong: If it detects something unusual, it will:
* Ask for extra proof it’s you (e.g., a security question or fingerprint) for small issues.
* Block risky actions (like big money transfers) for medium issues.
* Log you out and send an alert (via email or SMS) for big issues.
Privacy Protection: All data stays on your phone—no personal information is sent to a server. It only uses anonymous patterns (not your exact location or messages).
Low Battery Use: The system is designed to use very little power, so it doesn’t drain your phone battery.
Good-to-Have Features

These features are not essential but would make SecureBBA even better:

* User Customization: Let users choose how strict the system should be. For example, they can say, “I’m traveling, so don’t worry about my location.”
* App Notifications: Show a small message in the app if SecureBBA is about to lock the account, so users aren’t surprised.
* Support for Wearables: Use data from smartwatches (like heart rate or movement) to make the system even smarter at spotting fake users.
* Multi-Language Support: Make the app work in different languages for users around the world.

Constraints

* There are some limits to what SecureBBA can do:

Phone Sensors Needed: The system needs a phone with basic sensors (like a gyroscope and accelerometer) to work properly. Very old phones might not support it.
No Internet for Core Features: Since it works on the phone itself, the main security features don’t need internet. But sending alerts (like email or SMS) does need a connection.
Privacy Laws: SecureBBA must follow strict rules like India’s DPDP Act to protect user data, which means it can’t store or share personal details.
Battery and Speed: The system must be very light to avoid slowing down the phone or using too much battery.
Known Issues

Since SecureBBA is still a prototype, there are some challenges:

Tested with Fake Data: Right now, it uses synthetic data (made-up user habits) to test the system. We haven’t tried it with real people yet, so we don’t know how well it will work in real life.
False Alarms: Sometimes, it might think you’re a hacker even if you’re not—like if you’re typing slower because you’re tired. We need to make it smarter at understanding these situations.
Not Fully Built for Apps: The prototype isn’t connected to a real banking app yet. It needs more work to fit into an actual app and use real phone sensors.
Edge Cases: For people with disabilities or elderly users, their habits (like shaky hands) might look “unusual” to the system. We need to add better ways to adapt to these users.
